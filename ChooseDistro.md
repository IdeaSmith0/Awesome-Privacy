# Introduction

A list of checked GNU/Linux distributions that may or may not pass the checklist. In this page you will see a format of the Checklist and a list of Checked Linux distributions, there is a point system to ensure that whatever the ditribution has, will lose points, and will lower the chance of being recommended. The purpose of this is to counter the fact that if you want to try a distro, you first gonna need to trust it, or you are not sure which distro to choose. Copy the format of the checklist and make sure to paste it under your text editor or a notepad (digital).

Ubuntu Linux

- Derivative: Debian Unstable Branch
- Spyware: Yes, Mozilla Thunderbird and FireFox
- Telemetry: Optional
- Woke: No, but with corpo rot rules.
- SystemD: Yes.
- Free Software: Mixed.
- Corporate Ties: Owned by Conanical Ltd.
- Politics: No.
- Meets my Required Packages (Software): Yes, uses snap store.
- FOSS: Yes.
- Transparency: Yes. Development.
- Customizability: Yes.
- Controversy: Yes. Privacy, and Snap.

- Overall Score: 6 out of 10.
- Because: Owned by Conanical Ltd, Ships Spyware by default, aka FireFox and ThunderBird, Snap Store that is proprietary, and is most likely controversial.

- Recommended? Semi-Yes
- Reason: Since it is the most highly used ddistribution, I would say, the distribution itself isn't even that bad, modern day Ubuntu releases don't include telemetry or spyware as an Opt-Out or by default, they just present you the overall things and prompts from what they want from you, such as should you enable this setting to send hardware data to Conanical. Which that enablement just includes basic hardware data, you can say it's privacy respecting, but the moment you start to use Snap Store? Oh boy, spyware by default. Proprietary and cannot be fully audited.

I'll do this later.
