# Awesome Privacy (Wikipedia)

What you see here is a github page about privacy, basically just a regular awesome privacy page for github, and it's not going to be that perfect. For that there are going to be more added to the list, with details and specifications for that particular reason, and yet, there is more to be done: Operative System, Web Browser, Private Communications, Privacy Service Providers, Essential Privacy Tools, Miscellaneous. Those are from the Raccoon Privacy Website which can be found here (Huge ass inspiration, with some few additions and some changes to it).

https://web.archive.org/web/20240913110831/https://privacy.awiki.org/ | Quite recent but, it's now a long gone project but still a credible source of info of how it used to be useful back in the day.

If you have any non-fake privacy insitiatives, please submit a issue as a "new feature" and list a website that is still credible and up to date.
