# Introduction

A list of privacy tools that will help you remain private online, or maybe help you remain anonymous online if done right. The recommendation list has included software (and services)
that has been carefully reviewed, used (not geranteed), researched, and tested (also not geranteed), and for the sake of anyone wanting to use those: There is no such thing as a silver bullet when it comes to privacy.
But, these tools (software and services) will make tracking you a (very) difficult task, and if done right, you might be untrackable and be fully anonymous, but of course, it's not 100% and not geranteed, so take it with a grain of salt please.

# Grade Tiers

Grade A: Great Software/Service, it's better and doesn't have any problems that may concern the user in question.
Grade B: Good Software/Service, it's better and yet doesn't have problems, but little bit concerning and kinda needs a consideration from a user.
Grade C: Kinda Good Software/Service, it's not better and has some problems/issues that maybe questionable and concerning and might need a serious consideration.
Grade D: Kinda Bad Software/Service, it is not as good and has moderate problems/issues
